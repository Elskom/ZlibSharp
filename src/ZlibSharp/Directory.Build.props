    <PackageReleaseNotes>
      Added gzip support and more control over how compression/decompression is done based on the input Window Bits.

      For simplicity reasons, the Window Bits are stored inside of a ZlibWindowBits enum.

      Added types:
      - ZlibCompressionStrategy
      - ZlibWindowBits

      Added members in MemoryZlib:
      - IsCompressedByGZip
        - Note: There is no version of the function for raw deflate streams due to the fact that they lack a header and a footer unline zlib/gzip compressed data.
      - GetCompressedSize (works with deflate/zlib/gzip compressed data) No more worrying about over or even under allocating the buffers!!!
      - GetDecompressedSize (works with deflate/zlib/gzip compressed data) No more worrying about over or even under allocating the buffers!!!

      Changed members in MemoryZlib:
      - Compress (both versions) adding optional parameters. Please recompile any existing code using these methods as the original would not be found if not recompiled.
      - Decompress (both versions) adding optional parameters. Please recompile any existing code using these methods as the original would not be found if not recompiled.

      Internal Changes:
      - Migrated from deflateInit_/inflateInit_ to deflateInit2_/inflateInit2_ zlib apis due to needing more control over the compressed data.

      The result:
      - Performance improvement vs using System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream, System.IO.Compression.ZlibStream, and System.IO.Compression.GZipStream and supports more control over how to compress the data unlike those streams which lack said support.
